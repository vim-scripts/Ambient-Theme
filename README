Sets your vim theme's background based on ambient light.

WORKS ON OS X ONLY.

The plugin switches the background variable from light to dark. Works smoothly with solarized.

# Limitations

Vim doesn't have a timer. So this uses a hack which only works in Normal mode. That means the theme will switch after you exit Insert mode.

# Configuration

g:AmbientLightThreshold is the sensor value which triggers the switch. The default is 100000; you can experiment yourself if you want.

echo g:LightSensorValue will let you see the current value.

# Compiling the binary yourself

There's a binary that reads the light sensor value. It is precompiled for OSX 10.5 and later.

You'll need gcc to compile it IF YOU HAVE OSX 10.4 OR LESS. Otherwise, it's as simple as:

make clean; make
